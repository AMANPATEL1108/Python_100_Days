# Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?

## 🧠 What is Programming?

Programming is a way for us to **tell computers what to do**. A computer is a very **dumb machine** — it only does what we explicitly tell it to do.

We learn programming so that we can instruct computers to perform tasks — especially those we're slow at, like **complex calculations**. For example:

- If I ask you to calculate `5 + 6`, you'll immediately say `11`.
- But what about `23453453 × 56456`?  
  You’ll probably reach for a calculator or open a new tab to compute it.

This **100 Days of Code** series will help you learn Python from the ground up.  
We will start from **zero**, and by the time you finish this course, you'll be a **job-ready Python developer**!

## 🐍 What is Python?

Python is a **dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language** that supports:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Functional Programming (FP)

It is an **interpreted**, high-level language.

> 🧑‍💻 **Created by:** Guido van Rossum in 1989
